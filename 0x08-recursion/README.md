# RECURSION 

In this directory, you will see different cases of recursion both with variable, funtion, custom function like user-define puts, putchar, strlen, etc.

First file on this directory is a funtion that prints a string followed by a new line to the stdout. I will be doing that using a custom 'puts'.
In this file am going to include another file that calculates the strlen of the string to be printed. The file name is strlen.c.
