# alx-low_level_programming
I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository on C programming language as a full-stack engineer
This is where my journey started as a software engineer.
Firstly in this repo I will be handling projects on how the C program runs and compiles it program. And then, moved on to run my first ever C program "Hello World"
Stay tuned!
